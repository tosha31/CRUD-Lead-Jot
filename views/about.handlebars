<h1 class="text-center">About</h1>
<p class="text-center">I started in development of this application on 4-5-2018. This Is a fully functional application built on top of Node.js. I utilized Handlebars.js as a templating engine, and MongoDB for database architecture. The express.js framework is also utilized in this application. This is a CRUD application that I plan on using for my own purposes, however source code will be open on git. Day one I completed the following, installed all dependencies, configured all dependencies, wrote middleware for those dependencies, created all my routes, created database schema, and configured database connection. Created the entire front end, which btw is using Bootstrap and some Jquery. Version 1.0.1 I will add full user authentication, add some more fields, work on front end UI, and upload the application to either Heroku, or Digital Ocean.</p>
